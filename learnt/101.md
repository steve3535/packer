## first things first

### Initial remarks

* Always try manually first:
  
  * for OS image builds: familiarize yourself with the setup by installing it manually
  * Use identical provisionners as the ones meant to be used in the CI/CD, or at least a very closed one: qemu, openstack, vbox, vsphere, proxmox, etc ...
  * after the full manual, one step further beofre full automation should be to use a local runner
    
* Abuse packer logging (always run `PACKER_LOG=1 PACKER_LOG_PATH=/tmp/packer.log packer build .`)
* remember `headless = false` will make packer fail if running in an environment without graphical capability (**such as a gitlab runner**)  

### Install   

2 cases:
* **manual or shell executor**: Packer is a go binary, one can just fecth it from its download link and uncompress it onto an executable path with the name packer
* **docker**: use the hashicorp packer image: *hashicorp/packer*
